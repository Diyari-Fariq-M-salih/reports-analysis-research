# Research Reports & Theoretical Work

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as a structured archive for my reports, theoretical notes, and research-related material.  
Its purpose is to provide a clean, organized space to document learning, explore ideas, develop theory, and track progress over time.

The project includes final reports, in-depth derivations, drafts of ongoing work, and any supporting figures, data, or code used throughout the research process.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To maintain a **centralized collection** of my academic and theoretical work.
- To document **derivations, proofs, and conceptual explorations** clearly.
- To keep **reports and polished documents** easily accessible.
- To organize **drafts and early experiments** separately from final work.
- To use **version control** to track changes, revisions, and growth in understanding.
- To create a foundation that can scale as the research expands.
